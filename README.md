## Description

This container is customized to run on Kubernetes.

The docker on first run will download the same version as tagged of FTB Genesis and install it.  This can take a while as the Forge installer can take a bit to complete.  You can watch the logs and it will eventually finish.

After the first run it will simply start the server.

## Requirements

* /data mounted to a persistent disk
* Port 25565/tcp mapped
* environment variable EULA set to "true"

As the end user, you are repsonsible for accepting the EULA from Mojang to run their server, by default in the container it is set to false.

## Options

These environment variables can be set at run time to override their defaults.

* JVM_OPTS "-Xms4096m -Xmx6144m"
* MOTD "FTB Genesis Server Powered by Docker"
* LEVEL world

### Adding Minecraft Operators

Set the enviroment variable `OPS` with a comma separated list of players.

example:
`OPS="OpPlayer1,OpPlayer2"`

## Troubleshooting

### Accept the EULA
Did you pass in the environment variable EULA set to `true`?

### Permissions of Files
UID and GID set to 1000.  This may cause permission errors on the /data mount on other systems.

### Resetting
If the install is incomplete for some reason.  Deleting the downloaded server file in /data will restart the install/upgrade process.
